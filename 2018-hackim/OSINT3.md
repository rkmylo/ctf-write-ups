#OSINT3

##Description

Person is running a social engineering campaign. After initial inspection, his/her username was identified by our investigators. It was also found that this guy was signed up on Snapchat and Instachatbook around April 2017. However we cannot get hold of his phone number. 

Username identified was 'example1234'

Please help our investigators find his number.

##Solution

In order to solve this we acquired two leaks. One from Snapchat and one from Instachatbook. The user example1234 existed on both.

Snapchat had the phone number covering the last two digits ( 81579311XX ) while Instachatbook had the number covering all digits except last two (XXXXXXXX55).

This resulted in the full number which was the flag.
